# Project DD2-SbR
------------

### What is it?
Hi, my name is ChuZZZta and suddenly at the end of 2018 I decided to make a mod for my first game I ever played when I was a child. Destruction Derby II is old school game from 1996, it was released for DOS and PSX consoles, it is still a very fun way to spend free time but it lacks a few things:
- Lap numbers are static 
- Lack of ingame scoreboard
- Only three cars available
- Many more...

This mod actually tries to fix those issues and provide better gameplay. :) It is hard to list all my ideas how to improve this game, but as far as now, DD2-SbR Mod features:
 - Nice scoreboard in standalone app
 - Lap mode which allows players to change number of laps
 - Many more features coming soon... :)

------------

### How does it work and look?
It is just a standalone app written in C# which use memory read/write features to manipulate game data and provide additional score system. Also it include few other usefull
modes.

### Supported versions
##### Current support
- Play Station emulation (Mednafen 1.21.3 (NA version))

##### Planed future support
- DosBox emulation (DOSBox) - There is problem with NOCD version of this game so i don't want to touch this platform.

##### Suspended support
- Play Station emulation (ePSX) - I found that mednafen may be better for this mod
- Windows 7 - Game is very unstable on this OS

##### "I wanna to support other version"

Supporting other versions means getting a correct memory addresses for data (using for example programs such as CheatEngine) and providing that data to JSON driver config.
In future I will post youtube video how to provide support for other version but for now it is not my priority, so sorry. :)

### Current release
##### Sorry, the development of this app is currently suspended. Maybe i will come back to work on it or rewriting it completely. :)

------------


### Known bugs
Too many to list them all but i will try... ;)

- The scoreboard may be flickering a bit (due to low refresh rate, it refreshes only once per second)
- Motorplex map is not supported
- Some random crashes due to not user friendly interface ;)
